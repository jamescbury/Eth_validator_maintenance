# Eth_validator_maintenance
Some scripts I use to maintain my validator node.  Based on the [Guide for Staking on Ethereum](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-lighthouse-773f5d982e03) by Someresat on Medium for Unbuntu/Lighthouse

I wrote this to help me update the services for validator node quickly.  My set up is Nethermind & Lighthouse, I also run Mev-boost.  I've hard coded all of the directores based on the guide setup, if you've customized anything please update before you run.

The script contains prompts/links to the release repo as well as a reminder for myself about which configuration I run (I've updated to the wrong one once or twice... not fun).

To Do:  I'd really like to add some functionality in here that checks the file hash to make sure my download was authentic.
